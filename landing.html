										<h2>How I work</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Below is a selection of projects I’ve worked on in recent years. My goal is to showcase some of the various product management and user experience design techniques and methodologies my teams and I have used depending on the specific needs of a project. This includes the following areas where I am good or learning at a good pace.</p>
									<p>
										>> Product discovery: Using design thinking to solve user and business problems and improve product/market fit.
										<br />
										>> Product management: Developing product vision and strategy, functional specifications at the right fidelity.
										<br />
										>> Development process design: Understanding the needs of developers and the rest of the business.
										<br />
										>> User experience research: Ethnography, participatory design, concept testing, surveys.
										<br />
										>> Interaction design: Flow diagrams, wireframes, interactive prototypes, concept development.
